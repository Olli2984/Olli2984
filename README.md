## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hey!
I am Olli. I am from Germany and currently in the 12th grade of School. I am a bit of a Computer Nerd, my passion is to build up things on Linux. 
Currnetly I am running multiple Servers for my Friends and are generaly for everything there that has to do with IT.
In the past i did some C# and Python as well as some terimnal Scripting (.sh & .bat). Some times i also do a bit of HTML but that were mostly simple Projects just for fun
And a Funfact, Win + Ctrl + Shift + Alt + X opens Microsoft Exel when you are running windows
